course_parser
=============

parses courses from a gatech oscar list of courses. 

Assumes you have downloaded the HTML page with the list of courses from OSCAR.
Also assumes the HTML for OSCAR doesn't change. This is a relatively safe assumption.

time_retrieval takes the list of courses and creates a list of sections with class times and locations
